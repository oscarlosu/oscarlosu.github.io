              Consumer-oriented Virtual Reality (VR) hardware now allows users to interact with virtual environments 
              with their own hands through the use of hand-held spatially tracked controllers. However, the physics 
              constraints of the virtual environment do not apply to the userâ€™s real hands. This implies that if the virtual 
              hands follow the movements of the real hands exactly, the user can make the virtual hands break the expected physics 
              rules of the virtual environment e.g. by moving their real hands inside of virtual objects.

              'The result of adjusting the virtual hand\'s position');
          </script>  
          <p>
              We addressed the problem by prototyping ways of controlling hands in VR that allow the virtual hands to deviate 
              from the tracking data by adjusting the position, rotation and finger placement when there are conflicts between 
              the user input and the virtual environment constraints.

              Much like the input filtering or <a href="https://twitter.com/Gaohmee/status/903510060197744640"><u>hidden mechanics</u></a> often present in games to produce certain feelings in the player, 
              our hypothesis was that it is possible to adjust the virtual hands without reducing the sense of presence achieved 
              by one-to-one hand controllers by respecting the user's intentions and expectations about the outcomes of the movements 
              of their hands.
