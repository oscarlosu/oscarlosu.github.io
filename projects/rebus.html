            Rebus is a Chrome extension that uses Google Image Search to create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebus"><u>rebus</u></a> riddles from 
            sentences in any website. That is, it translates the text into a sequence of images for you to decipher.

            The hypothesis is that Google's success as a search engine - specifically their image search - implies that when we search for an image 
            using a single word we find images that are related to that word, that are symbols for that word. How easy it is to guess the meaning of 
            these symbols must be related to how good the search is.

            This project is an exploration of the idea that good search engines are, in a sense, models that reflect our culture and way of thinking. 
            They have to guess what we are looking with only a few words. Can we guess a word given their first image search result?

            The project was developed at Exile Game Jam with the theme "Not a Game" over the course of two days and received the "Best Technically Not A Game" award.
