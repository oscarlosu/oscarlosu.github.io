            Too often fast paced mobile games have virtual buttons on the screen imitating traditional gamepads. 
            This has a well-known problem: we can't feel when our fingers are on the virtual buttons with our sense of touch. 
            This misplaces attention that should be on the game itself on interfacing with it. In this prototype, we dealt with 
            this issue by having the whole screen be one single button. Tap the screen to jump. That's how you play.

            How this single button should work, however, can be a nuanced issue. For us, the question was whether the jump should 
            happen when the button was pressed or when it was released. Although typically one would choose the former in the name of 
            responsiveness, we felt that having the jump on release allowed us to have a more natural mapping between the player's movement 
            and the character's movement: the player presses the button and the character bends their knees in preparation, the player releases 
            the button and the character jumps up. This also seemed to leave space for controlling how high the character should jump by holding 
            down the button for more or less time before jumping. Additionally, we could use the position of the finger on the screen to decide what 
            direction to jump in: the character jumps towards the finger.
