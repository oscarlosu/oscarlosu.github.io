                        You play as Tip, the apprentice of Master QWERTY, on a quest to find your inner Key. 
                        The basic premise is that the game's world is spatially mapped to the keyboard layout: 
                        when you press a key with your finger, Tip moves to that key in the game (wordplay very 
                        much intended).

                        Much of my work on this project was designing and implementing prototypes that explored the core idea of the game. 
                        To do this I often thought of the keyboard's physical properties and about the sensations and feelings produced by 
                        interacting with it in different ways.

                        Another prototype embodies the player's fingers in the legs of a triped machine. The legs of the machine move to the keys you press and you need to move through
                        levels without making the tripping or losing balance.

                        Also playing with embodied interaction and the vague notion that there is some sort of spring under each keyboard key, 
                        the player jumps on the keys as one might on an elastic bed in real life.
