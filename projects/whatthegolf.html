            We made a deal with the devil and he made us make a golf game. We found out two things: 
            (1) golf is boring, but (2) everything is golf. What if you golf the golfer? What if the 
            ball is the club? What if you golf many balls? What if you golf the hole?

            As in Keyboard Sports, I designed and developed prototypes building on the game's core ideas, 
            but because I joined this project later in it's development I relied more on level design and 
            exploring existing mechanics in order to minimize the time it took to start producing content.

        <p>     
            Later on however, I couldn't resist making levels that required programming additional behaviors. 
            In one of them the flag avoids you and in another one a sneaky shadow chases you and tries to kick 
            you out of the course.
