                        The anti-golf game for people who hate golf. Golf a ragdoll, house, a car and other things in completely ridiculous ways.

                      We made a deal with the devil and he made us make a golf game. In the process we found that (1) golf is boring, but (2) everything is golf. And thus, most of the levels in the game are based on subverting what golf is and turning something that is not golf into golf. We examined however little we knew about the details of golf and turned each of them into a playable joke.

                      I was a gameplay and level designer and programmer for What the Golf?. In that position, I worked independently, with nothing more specific in the way of tasks than coming up with new gameplay ideas and making prototypes for them.

                      I am very interested in programming as a creative thinking tool. The exercise of programming a design idea is like looking at it with a microscope. Because it forces you to specify and define exactly every minute detail, it helps to realize that no detail is given, but is instead a design choice opportunity. With this mindset, it can be a powerful tool to discover and inspect design spaces.

                      Does the club help you get the ball in the hole? Why is only the ball moving? One of my prototypes turned the flag against you by making it avoid the ball. The gameplay was about figuring out the pattern the flag used to avoid you. You would encounter this antagonising flag multiple times in the game and it would get increasingly smart in how it avoided you in successive encounters, building up the narrative of antagonist.
