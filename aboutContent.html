    <p>
    I'm a game developer focused on gameplay design and programming. I live in Copenhagen, Denmark, 
    where I spend half of my time making games from <a href="http://triband.net"><u>Triband</u></a>'s underground headquarters.
    </p>
    <p>
    The other half I spend devouring movies, series and games, reminding myself that I should read more, lamenting my broken trumpet 
    player dreams and attending game jams.
    </p>
    <p>
    I would like to make games that aren't endogamic, games that can be meaningful to anyone and everyone, regardless of whether they 
    have ever played a game before.
