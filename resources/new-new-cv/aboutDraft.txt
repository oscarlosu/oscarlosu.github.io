I'm a game designer and developer based in Copenhagen, Denmark. My main areas of interest and expertise are gameplay and interaction design, and programming.
I want to make games that aren't endogamic, games that can be meaningful to anyone and everyone, regardless of whether they have ever played a game before.
This website aims to give an idea of the work I can do by showing a selection of games I have worked on. For each project, I write briefly about my roles and contribution, and include some snippets of design thinking and process. If you'd like to hear more about my work, you can find my email - which I check regularly - inside my CV, linked below.
