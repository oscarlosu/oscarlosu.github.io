I'm a game designer and developer based in Copenhagen, Denmark. My main areas of interest and expertise are gameplay and interaction design, and programming.
I want to make games that aren't endogamic, games that can be meaningful to anyone and everyone, regardless of whether they have ever played a game before.
This website aims to give an idea the work I can do by showing a selection of games I have worked on. For each project, I write briefly and in no way comprehensively about my roles, contribution and include some snippets of design and process. If you'd like to hear more about my work, you can find my email - which I check regularly - inside my CV, linked below.
