I'm a game designer and developer based in Copenhagen, Denmark. My main professional areas of interest and expertise are gameplay and interaction design, and programming.
I used to want to study Philosophy, I am an avid consumer of cinema and games and I might always have to remind myself that I should read more and lament my broken trumpet player dreams.
I want to make games that aren't endogamic, games that can be meaningful to anyone and everyone, regardless of whether they have ever played a game before.
