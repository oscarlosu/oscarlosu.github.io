VERTO is a rhythm based shooter where the player needs to pay attention to the beat to gain the edge in this game that will truly put your abilities to the test.

Make your way though a level filled with dangerous enemies as you move, shoot and transform your ship to the beat of the music.

Control the game using either an Xbox 360 controller or Mouse/Keyboard, and pay attention to the music as you transform your ship to different colors that can help you avoid enemy fire, or load up your arsenal.
