Scrappers is a local multiplayer space brawler where players build their own spaceships and then battle to blow the rest up in a glorious mess of pew. The ships are built from components that define the ship’s functionality. Components with activated functions are mapped to buttons on the gamepad by the player as they build their ships. As the ships take damage, components are lost and ships lose the functionality they provided.
